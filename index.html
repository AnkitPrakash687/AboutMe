						<p> 
						I am from India. I have completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics in 2014 from Nagpur University.
						I had worked as a software developer for 4 years in Tech Mahindra where my role was to enhance and maintain an AT&T Marketing 
						and Campaign Management data warehouse on platforms like Java, Mainframes, Cobol, Teradata, Oracle and Unix Shell Scripting. 
						When I am not working, I like cooking, reading and hitting gym or go for walk/jog.
